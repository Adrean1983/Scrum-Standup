# Scrum-Standup

### Todos

- Adding a TM to add-remove-form in one team 1 is blocked if TM is in team 1, but in all list or another team they can be added. Creating duplicates. Instead check whole DB when adding a TM instead of current team
- How to add/manage a person who should be part of more than one team. Should a TM teams list be an array?
- When closing an active TM in daily scrum it should set timer to zero and remove reset button. 
- UI stuff
  - When all TMs have been closed off for the day should there be a message that displays?
  - More clear indicator to which team a TM is being added
